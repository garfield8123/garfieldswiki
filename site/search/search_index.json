The attacker\u2019s objective is for the target system to return data it should not or execute a program it should not. Provide payment details: The attacker would check if the payment details are sent in cleartext or using weak encryption. Encryption refers to making the data unreadable without knowing the secret key or password. Identification and Authentication Failure Identification refers to the ability to identify a user uniquely. In contrast, authentication refers to the ability to prove that the user is whom they claim to be.

Cryptographic Failures Cryptography focuses on the processes of encryption and decryption of data. Encryption scrambles cleartext into ciphertext, which should be gibberish to anyone who does not have the secret key to decrypt it. In other words, encryption ensures that no one can read the data without knowing the secret key. Decryption converts the ciphertext back into the original cleartext using the secret key.

As with regular CSRF, the attacker can send arbitrary messages to the server-side application. If the application uses client-generated WebSocket messages to perform any sensitive actions, then the attacker can generate suitable messages cross-domain and trigger those actions. Retrieve sensitive data that the user can access. Unlike with regular CSRF, cross-site WebSocket hijacking gives the attacker two-way interaction with the vulnerable application over the hijacked WebSocket. If the application uses server-generated WebSocket messages to return any sensitive data to the user, then the attacker can intercept those messages and capture the victim user's data. How to perform In terms of the normal conditions for CSRF attacks, you typically need to find a handshake message that relies solely on HTTP cookies for session handling and doesn't employ any tokens or other unpredictable values in request parameters.

The typical authentication method is a challenge-response method wherein the user enters a username and secret password to confirm their identity Backdoor A security weakness that a cracker places on a host to bypass security firewalls Bastion host A highly secured computer that serves as an organization main porint of presence on the internet. A bastion host typically resides on the perimeter network, but a dual-homed hosted (with one network itnerface connected to the internet and the other to the internal network) is also called a bastion host Buffer overeflow A security flaw in a progra that enables a cracker to send an excessive amount of data to that program and to overwrite parts of the running gprogram iwth code in the data being sent. The result is that the cracker can execute arbitrary code on the systemand possibly gain access to the system as a privlleged user. The exec-shield feature of the linux kernel protects against buffer overflows Certificate Electronic document that identifies an entity (such as person, an organization, or a cocmputer) and associates a public key with that identity. A certificate contains the certificate holder's name, a serial number, an expiration date, a copy of the certificate holder's public key, and the digital signature of the certificate authority so that a receipent can verify that the certificate is real Certificate authority (CA) An organization that validates identifies and issues certificates Cracker A person who breaks into (or attempts to break into) a host, often with malicious intent DDOS A variant of DOS that uses a coordinated attack from a distributed system of computers rather than a single source. Often uses worms to spread to -- and take control of -- multiple computers that can then attack the target Decryption The process of transforming encrypted information into its original, intelligible form Digital signature A one way MD5 (Message Digest algorithm 5) or SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm -1) hash of a message encrypted with the private key of the message originator, used to verify the integrity of a message and ensure nonrepudiation DMZ Aother name for the perimeter network DoS Attack that uses so many of the resources on your computer and network that legitmate users can't access and use the system. From a single source, the attack overwhelms the target computer with messages and blocks legitimate traffic. Dual-homes host A computer with two network interfaces Encryption The process of transforming information so that it's unintelligible to anyone but the intended recipient. Transformation is performed by a mathematical operation between a key and the information Exploit tools Publicly available and sophisticated tools that intruders of various skill levels can use to determine vulnerabilities and gain entry into targeted systems Firewall A controlled-acess gateway between an organization's internal network and the internet. A dual-homed host can be configured as a firewall Hash The result when a mathematical function converts a message to a fixed-size numberic value known as a message edigest (or hash). The MD5 algorithm, for example, produces a 128 bit message digest. SHA 1 generates a 160 bit message digest. The hash of a message is encrypted with the private key of the sender to produce the digital signature Host A computer on a network that's configured to offer services to other computers on the network Integrity For received data, a state of being the same as originally sent (that is unaltered in transit) IP Spoofing An attack in which a cracker figures out the IP address of a trusted host and then sends packets that appear to come from the trusted host. The attacker can send packets but can't see responses. But the attacker can predict the sequence of packets and essentially send commands that set up a backdoor for future break-ins IPSec (IP Security protocol) Security protocol for the network layer of the OSI networking model, designed to provide cryptographic security services for IP packets. IPSec provides encryption based authentication, integrity, access control, and confidentialitiy Logic bomb Form of sabotage in which programmer inserts code that causes the program to perform a destructive action when some triggering event occurs, such as terminating the programmer's employment Nonrepudiation Security feature that prevents the sender of data from being able to deny having sent the data packet A collection of bytes, assembled accoridng to a specific protocol, that serves as the basic unit of communication on a network. On TCP/IP networks, for example, the packet may be referred to as an IP packet or a TCP/IP packet packet filtering Selective blocking of packets according to type of packet (as specified by the source and destination IP address or port) Perimeter network Netowrk between the internet and the protected internal network. The perimeter network (DMZ) where the bastion host resides Port Scanning Method of discovering which ports are open on a system, performed by sending connection requests to the ports. Procedure is usally a precursor to further attacks (nmap and netstat) proxy server Server on the bastion host that enables internal clients to access external servers (enables external clients to access servers inside the protected network). Public Key Cryptography An encryption method that uses a pair of keys -- a private key and a public key -- to encrypt and decrypt the information. Anything encrypted with the public key can be decrypted only with the corresponding private key Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) A set of standards and services that enables the use of public key cryotography and certificates in a networked environment, PKI facilities tasks such as issuing, renewing, and revoking certificates, and generating and distributing public and private key pairs Screening router Internet router that filters packets Setuid Program Setuid or suid runs with the permissions of the pgogram owner, regardless of who actually runs it. If root owns a setuid/suid program that program has root privileges regardless of who started the program. Crackers often exploit vulnerabilites in setuid programs to gain privileged access to a system. se group id (sgid) same issue Sniffer packet sniffer -- a program that intercepts routed data and exmamines each packet in search of specified information such as passwords transmitted in clear text Spyware Software that covertly gathers user information through the user's internet connection and usually transmits that information in the background to someone else. Spyware can also gather information about email addresses and even passwords and credit card numbers. Spyware is similar to a Trojan horse in that users are tricked into isntalling spyware when they install something else Symmetric key encryption An encryption method wherein the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the information Threat An event or activity, delierate or unintentional, with the potential for causing harm to a systemme or network Trojan horse A program that masquerades a sbenign program, but is really backdoor used for attacking a system. Attacks often install a collection of Trojan horse programs that enable the attacker to freely access the system with root privileges yet hide that fact from the system administrator. Such collections of Trojan horse programs are called rootkits virus Self replicating program that spreads from one computer to another by attaching itself to other programs vulnerability A flaw or weakness that may cause harm to a system or network War-dialing Using simple programs that dial consecutive phone numbers looking for modems War-driving A method of gaining entry into wireless computer networks that uses a computer, antennas, and a wireless network card and that involves patrolling locations to gain unauthorized access worm A self-replicating program that copies itself from one computer to another over a network Common Security Tools Tool Description chage Modify the time between required password chanes (both min, max number of days), the number of days of warning to be given that a change must be made find Allows you to find anathing on the machine lsof list open files netstat Status of the networkr, including network connections, routing tales and statistics per interface.

When a connection from the ssh client arrives sshd performs authentication by using public key cryotpgraphy and establishes an encrypted communication link with the ssh client /usr/bin/ssh Users cna run this ssh client to log in to a host running sshd. /usr/bin/slogin Component is a symbolic link to /usr/bin/ssh /usr/bin/scp Secure copy program works like rcp, but secure. Uses SSH for data transfer and provides the same authentication and security as ssh /usr/bin/ssh-keygen Generate the public and private key pairs that you need for public key cryotogrpahy in Openssh. generate key pairs for both RSA and DSA (Digital signature algorithm). /etc/ssh/sshd_config Configuration file for the sshd server specifies many parameters for sshd, including the port to listen to, the protcol to use, and the location of other files /etc/sshd/ssh_config Configuration file for the ssh client, each user can have an ssh configuration file named config in the .ssh subdirectory of the user's home directory Security files to be aware File Description /etc/nologin If this file exists, denies login to all users except root. File can be handy when maintenace needs to be done and users need to stay off the system for a period of time. Removing the file restores login capability for all users. The file can be created as a text file with any editor, or you can often use the nologin command to create it /etc/passwd Holds much of the user account information /etc/shadow When shadowing is turned on -- which it almost always is -- password vlaues (hashes) are stored in this file (which is more secure) as opposed to in /etc/passwd /etc/xinetd.d/* Directory can be used to store configuration files used by xinetd, the server daemon /etc/xinetd.conf This file is the main configuration file used by xinetd, the server daemon /etc/inetd.d/* Directory can be used to store configuration files used by inetd, the internet daemon in almost all distributions inetd has been replaced by xinetd /etc/inetd.conf This file is the main configuration file used by inetd, the internet daemon /etc/inittab This file is the initial startup (initialization) table used to identify what starts and stps as the system is booted and changes run states /etc/init.d/* The directory can hold configuration files that are used during the change of run states level and referenced by inittab file /etc/hosts.allow If this file exists, it specifcaly lists the hosts that are allowed to network with this one, if the file doesn't exist, by default all hosts are allowed to network with this one /etc/hosts.deny If this file exists, it specifically lists the hosts that aren't allowed to network with this one. Having an allow file that identifies only hosts that can network with this one; having a deny file that identifies only hosts that can't connect with this one; having neither file, allows all other hosts to network with this one Security Audits independent verification=organization comlies with its existing policies and procedures for computer security (nontechnical aspect) Independent testing=technical aspect Nontechnical aspect documents, interviewing people Technical aspect how well host and network is secured.

Any vulnerability in Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs used with web servers to process interactive web pages can give attackers a way to gain access to a systme Authentication User accounts sometimes have no passwords or have weak passwords that are easily cracked by password-cracking programs CVS,Subversion Concurrent Versions Systems (CVS) popular source code control system in Linux systems. Subversion is another version control system. These version control systems have vulnerabilites that can enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code sendmail Complex program used to transport mail messages from one system to another. SNMP Simple Network Management Protocl (SNMP) used to remotely monitor and administer various network connected systems ranging from routers to computers. SNMP lacks good access control, so an attacker may be able to reconfigure or shut down your system running SNMP Open Secure Sockets Layer (Open SSL) Many applications such as Apache Web Server use OpenSSL to provide crytogrpahic security for network connection. Network File System (NFS) and Network Information Service (NIS) Both NFS and NIS have many security problems (buffer overflow, potential for denial-of-service attacks, and weak authentication). NFS and NIS are often misconfigured, which could allow local and remote users to exploit the security holes Databases Databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL are complex applications that can be difficult to configure and secure correctly. These databases have many features that can be misused or exploited to compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of data Linux Kernel The Linux kernel is susceptible to many

protocols, such as FTP, HTTP, NNTP, and ssh Authentication Process of confirming that a user is indeed who they claim to be. The typical authentication method is a challenge-response method wherein the user enters a username and secret password to confirm their identity Backdoor A security weakness that a cracker places on a host to bypass security firewalls Bastion host A highly secured computer that serves as an organization main porint of presence on the internet. A bastion host typically resides on the perimeter network, but a dual-homed hosted (with one network itnerface connected to the internet and the other to the internal network) is also called a bastion host Buffer overeflow A security flaw in a progra that enables a cracker to send an excessive amount of data to that program and to overwrite parts of the running gprogram iwth code in the data being sent. The result is that the cracker can execute arbitrary code on the systemand possibly gain access to the system as a privlleged user. The exec-shield feature of the linux kernel protects against buffer overflows Certificate Electronic document that identifies an entity (such as person, an organization, or a cocmputer) and associates a public key with that identity. A certificate contains the certificate holder's name, a serial number, an expiration date, a copy of the certificate holder's public key, and the digital signature of the certificate authority so that a receipent can verify that the certificate is real Certificate authority (CA) An organization that validates identifies and issues certificates Cracker A person who breaks into (or attempts to break into) a host, often with malicious intent DDOS A variant of DOS that uses a coordinated attack from a distributed system of computers rather than a single source. Often uses worms to spread to -- and take control of -- multiple computers that can then attack the target Decryption The process of transforming encrypted information into its original, intelligible form Digital signature A one way MD5 (Message Digest algorithm 5) or SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm -1) hash of a message encrypted with the private key of the message originator, used to verify the integrity of a message and ensure nonrepudiation DMZ Aother name for the perimeter network DoS Attack that uses so many of the resources on your computer and network that legitmate users can't access and use the system. From a single source, the attack overwhelms the target computer with messages and blocks legitimate traffic. Dual-homes host A computer with two network interfaces Encryption The process of transforming information so that it's unintelligible to anyone but the intended recipient. Transformation is performed by a mathematical operation between a key and the information Exploit tools Publicly available and sophisticated tools that intruders of various skill levels can use to determine vulnerabilities and gain entry into targeted systems Firewall A controlled-acess gateway between an organization's internal network and the internet. A dual-homed host can be configured as a firewall Hash The result when a mathematical function converts a message to a fixed-size numberic value known as a message edigest (or hash). The MD5 algorithm, for example, produces a 128 bit message digest. SHA 1 generates a 160 bit message digest. The hash of a message is encrypted with the private key of the sender to produce the digital signature Host A computer on a network that's configured to offer services to other computers on the network Integrity For received data, a state of being the same as originally sent (that is unaltered in transit) IP Spoofing An attack in which a cracker figures out the IP address of a trusted host and then sends packets that appear to come from the trusted host. The attacker can send packets but can't see responses. But the attacker can predict the sequence of packets and essentially send commands that set up a backdoor for future break-ins IPSec (IP Security protocol) Security protocol for the network layer of the OSI networking model, designed to provide cryptographic security services for IP packets. IPSec provides encryption based authentication, integrity, access control, and confidentialitiy Logic bomb Form of sabotage in which programmer inserts code that causes the program to perform a destructive action when some triggering event occurs, such as terminating the programmer's employment Nonrepudiation Security feature that prevents the sender of data from being able to deny having sent the data packet A collection of bytes, assembled accoridng to a specific protocol, that serves as the basic unit of communication on a network. On TCP/IP networks, for example, the packet may be referred to as an IP packet or a TCP/IP packet packet filtering Selective blocking of packets according to type of packet (as specified by the source and destination IP address or port) Perimeter network Netowrk between the internet and the protected internal network. The perimeter network (DMZ) where the bastion host resides Port Scanning Method of discovering which ports are open on a system, performed by sending connection requests to the ports. Procedure is usally a precursor to further attacks (nmap and netstat) proxy server Server on the bastion host that enables internal clients to access external servers (enables external clients to access servers inside the protected network). Public Key Cryptography An encryption method that uses a pair of keys -- a private key and a public key -- to encrypt and decrypt the information. Anything encrypted with the public key can be decrypted only with the corresponding private key Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) A set of standards and services that enables the use of public key cryotography and certificates in a networked environment, PKI facilities tasks such as issuing, renewing, and revoking certificates, and generating and distributing public and private key pairs Screening router Internet router that filters packets Setuid Program Setuid or suid runs with the permissions of the pgogram owner, regardless of who actually runs it. If root owns a setuid/suid program that program has root privileges regardless of who started the program. Crackers often exploit vulnerabilites in setuid programs to gain privileged access to a system. se group id (sgid) same issue Sniffer packet sniffer -- a program that intercepts routed data and exmamines each packet in search of specified information such as passwords transmitted in clear text Spyware Software that covertly gathers user information through the user's internet connection and usually transmits that information in the background to someone else. Spyware can also gather information about email addresses and even passwords and credit card numbers. Spyware is similar to a Trojan horse in that users are tricked into isntalling spyware when they install something else Symmetric key encryption An encryption method wherein the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the information Threat An event or activity, delierate or unintentional, with the potential for causing harm to a systemme or network Trojan horse A program that masquerades a sbenign program, but is really backdoor used for attacking a system. Attacks often install a collection of Trojan horse programs that enable the attacker to freely access the system with root privileges yet hide that fact from the system administrator. Such collections of Trojan horse programs are called rootkits virus Self replicating program that spreads from one computer to another by attaching itself to other programs vulnerability A flaw or weakness that may cause harm to a system or network War-dialing Using simple programs that dial consecutive phone numbers looking for modems War-driving A method of gaining entry into wireless computer networks that uses a computer, antennas, and a wireless network card and that involves patrolling locations to gain unauthorized access worm A self-replicating program that copies itself from one computer to another over a network","title":"Common Security terminaology"},{"location":"Linux/GeneralLinux/linuxsecurity/#common-security-tools","text":"Tool Description chage Modify the time between required password chanes (both min, max number of days), the number of days of warning to be given that a change must be made find Allows you to find anathing on the machine lsof list open files netstat Status of the networkr, including network connections, routing tales and statistics per interface.

MAILER delcarations are always placed at the end of the sendmail.mc file, and MAILER (smtp) always precedes MAILER (procmail). The mailer smtp refers to the SMTP mailer FEATURE Macros request various speciail features. FEATURE ('blacklist_recipents'), for example turns on the capability to block incoming mail for certain usernames, hosts, or addresses. The specification of what mail to allow or refuse is placed in the access database MASQUERADE_AS('mydomain.com') Causes sendmail to label outgoing mail as having come from the host mydomain.com. The idea is for a large organization to setup a single sendmail server that handles the mail for many subdomains and makes everything appear to come from a single domain. MASQUERADE_DOMAIN(subdomain.mydomain.com) Instructs sendmail to send mail from an address such as user@subdomain .com as having originated from the same username as the domain specified by the MASQUERADE_AS macro Syntax of sendmail.cf Operator Description C Defines a class, a variable (think of it as a set) that can cotain several values. Cwlocalhost adds the name localhost to the class w D Defines a macro, a name associated with a single value. DnMAILER-DAEMON defines the macro n as MAILER-DAEMON F Defines a class that's been read from a file. FW /etc/mail/local-host-names reads the names of hosts from the file /etc/mail/local-host-names and adds them to the class w H Defines the format of header lines that sendmail inserts into a message. H?P?Return-Path:<$g> defines the Return-Path: field of the header K Defines a map (a key-value pari database). Karith arith defines the map named arith as the compiled in map of the name M Specifies a mailer.

When a fix is unavailable, the necessary measures should be taken to prevent an attacker from exploiting it. Although remediating vulnerabilities is vital to a SOC, it is not necessarily assigned to them. Policy violations: A security policy is a set of rules required to protect the network and systems. For example, it might be a policy violation if users upload confidential company data to an online storage service. Unauthorized activity: Consider the case where a user\u2019s login name and password are stolen, and the attacker uses them to log into the network. A SOC must detect and block such an event as soon as possible before further damage is done. Network intrusions: No matter how good your security is, there is always a chance for an intrusion. An intrusion can occur when a user clicks on a malicious link or when an attacker exploits a public server. Either way, when an intrusion occurs, we must detect it as soon as possible to prevent further damage. Threat Intelligence information you gather about actual and potential enemies. A threat is any action that can disrupt or adversely affect a system. Threat intelligence collects information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries. The purpose would be to achieve a threat-informed defence. Different companies have different adversaries. Some adversaries might seek to steal customer data from a mobile operator; however, other adversaries are interested in halting the production in a petroleum refinery. Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) Digital Forensics Incident Response Malware Analysis Digital Forensics the application of science to investigate crimes and establish facts In defensive security, the focus of digital forensics shifts to analyzing evidence of an attack and its perpetrators and other areas such as intellectual property theft, cyber espionage, and possession of unauthorized content File System: Analyzing a digital forensics image (low-level copy) of a system\u2019s storage reveals much information, such as installed programs, created files, partially overwritten files, and deleted files. System memory: If the attacker runs their malicious program in memory without saving it to the disk, taking a forensic image (low-level copy) of the system memory is the best way to analyze its contents and learn about the attack. System logs: Each client and server computer maintains different log files about what is happening. Log files provide plenty of information about what happened on a system. Even if the attacker tries to clear their traces, some traces will remain. Network logs: Logs of the network packets that have traversed a network would help answer more questions about whether an attack is occurring and what it entails. Incident Response refers to a data breach or cyber attack; however, in some cases, it can be something less critical, such as a misconfiguration, an intrusion attempt, or a policy violation. Examples of a cyber attack include an attacker making our network or systems inaccessible, defacing (changing) the public website, and data breach (stealing company data) Preparation: This requires a team trained and ready to handle incidents. Ideally, various measures are put in place to prevent incidents from happening in the first place. Detection and Analysis: The team has the necessary resources to detect any incident; moreover, it is essential to analyze any detected incident further to learn about its severity. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery: Once an incident is detected, it is crucial to stop it from affecting other systems, eliminate it, and recover the affected systems. For instance, when we notice that a system is infected with a computer virus, we would like to stop (contain) the virus from spreading to other systems, clean (eradicate) the virus, and ensure proper system recovery. Post-Incident Activity: After a successful recovery, a report is produced, and the lesson learned is shared to prevent similar future incidents. Malware Analysis virus: is a piece of code (part of a program) that attaches itself to a program. It is designed to spread from one computer to another and works by altering, overwriting, and deleting files once it infects a computer. The result ranges from the computer becoming slow to unusable.

Relevant Laws and Regulations Law/Regulation Domain Description General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Data Privacy & Protection GDPR is a regulation propagated by the European Union that sets strict requirements for how organisations handle and protect and secure the personal data of EU citizens and residents. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Healthcare A US-based official law to maintain the sensitivity of health-related information of citizens. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) Financial Set technical and operational requirements to ensure the secure handling, storage, processing, and transmission of cardholder data by merchants, service providers, and other entities that handle payment cards. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) Financial Financial companies must be sensitive to their customers' nonpublic personal information (NPI), including implementing information security programs, providing privacy notices, and disclosing information-sharing practices. Information Security Frameworks provides a comprehensive set of documents that outline the organisation's approach to information security and governs how security is implemented, managed, and enforced within the organisation. Policies: A formal statement that outlines an organisation's goals, principles, and guidelines for achieving specific objectives. Standards: A document establishing specific requirements or specifications for a particular process, product, or service. Guidelines: A document that provides recommendations and best practices (non-mandatory) for achieving specific goals or objectives. Procedures: Set of specific steps for undertaking a particular task or process. Baselines: A set of minimum security standards or requirements that an organisation or system must meet. Developing Goverance Documents Identify the scope and purpose: Determine what the document will cover and why it is needed. For example, a password policy might be required to ensure robust and secure user passwords. In contrast, a baseline might be required to establish a minimum level of security for all systems. Research and review: Research relevant laws, regulations, industry standards, and best practices to ensure your document is comprehensive and up-to-date. Review existing policies, procedures, and other documents to avoid duplicating efforts or contradicting existing guidance. Draft the document: Develop an outline and start drafting the document, following best practices for writing clear and concise policies, procedures, standards, guidelines, and baselines. Ensure the document is specific, actionable, and aligned with the organisation's goals and values. Review and approval: Have the document reviewed by stakeholders, such as subject matter experts, legal and compliance teams, and senior management. Incorporate their feedback and ensure the document aligns with organisational goals and values. Obtain final approval from appropriate stakeholders. Implementation and communication: Communicate the document to all relevant employees and stakeholders, and ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities in implementing it. Develop training and awareness programs to ensure the document is understood and followed. Review and update: Periodically review and update the document to ensure it remains relevant and practical. Monitor compliance and adjust the document based on feedback and changes in the threat landscape or regulatory environment. Preparing password policy Define password requirements: Minimum length, complexity, and expiration. Define password usage guidelines: Specify how passwords should be used, such as requiring unique passwords for each account, prohibiting the sharing of passwords, and prohibiting default passwords. Define password storage and transmission guidelines: Using encryption for password storage and requiring secure connections for password transmission. Define password change and reset guidelines: How often passwords should be changed etc. Communicate the policy: Communicate the password policy to all relevant employees and stakeholders, and ensure that they understand the requirements and guidelines. Develop training and awareness programs to ensure that employees follow the policy. Monitor compliance: Monitor compliance with the password policy and adjust the policy as needed based on feedback and changes in the threat landscape or regulatory environment. Incident Response Procedure Define incident types: Unauthorised access, malware infections, or data breaches. Define incident response roles and responsibilities: Identify the stakeholders, such as incident response team members, IT personnel, legal and compliance teams, and senior management. Detailed Steps: Develop step-by-step procedures for responding to each type of incident, including initial response steps, such as containing the incident and preserving evidence; analysis and investigation steps, such as identifying the root cause and assessing the impact; response and recovery steps, such as mitigating the incident, reporting and restoring normal operations. Report the incident to management and document the incident response process for future reference. Communicate the incident response procedures. Review and update the incident response procedures. Governance and Risk Compliance (GRC) framework Governance Component: Involves guiding an organisation by setting its direction through information security strategy, which includes policies, standards, baselines, frameworks, etc., along with establishing appropriate monitoring methods to measure its performance and assess the outcomes. Risk Management Component: Involves identifying, assessing, and prioritising risks to the organisation and implementing controls and mitigation strategies to manage those risks effectively. This includes monitoring and reporting on risks and continuously evaluating and refining the risk management program to ensure its ongoing effectiveness. Compliance Component: Ensuring that the organisation meets its legal, regulatory, and industry obligations and that its activities align with its policies and procedures. This includes developing and implementing compliance programs, conducting regular audits and assessments, and reporting on compliance issues to stakeholders. Develop GRC Program Define the scope and objectives: This step involves determining the scope of the GRC program and defining its goals. For example, a company can implement a GRC program for its customer data management system. The objective might be to reduce cyber risks to 50% in the next 12 months while maintaining the trust of its customers. Conduct a risk assessment: In this step, the organisation identifies and assesses its cyber risks. For example, a risk assessment might reveal that the customer data management system is vulnerable to external attacks due to weak access controls or outdated software. The organisation can then prioritize these risks and develop a risk management strategy. Develop policies and procedures: Policies and procedures are developed to guide cyber security practices within the organisation. For example, the company might establish a password policy to ensure the usage of strong passwords. They might also implement logging and monitoring system access procedures to detect suspicious activity. Establish governance processes: Governance processes ensure the GRC program is effectively managed and controlled. For example, the organisation might establish a security steering committee that meets regularly to review security risks and make decisions about security investments and priorities. Roles and responsibilities are defined to ensure everyone understands their role in the program. Implement controls: Technical and non-technical controls are implemented to mitigate risks identified in risk assessment. For example, the company might implement firewalls, Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) to prevent external attacks and impart employee training to improve security awareness and reduce the risk of human error. Monitor and measure performance: Processes are established to monitor and measure the effectiveness of the GRC program. For example, the organisation can track metrics and compliance with security policies. This information is used to identify areas for improvement and adjust the program as needed. Continuously improve: The GRC program is constantly reviewed and improved based on performance metrics, changing risk profiles, and stakeholder feedback. For example, suppose the organisation experiences a security incident. In that case, it might conduct a post-incident analysis to identify the root cause and make changes to prevent a similar incident from happening again. GRC Framework Example Governance-Related Activities: Nominate the governance level executives, and make financial-related policies such as bank secrecy act, anti-money laundering policy, financial audit policies, financial reporting, crisis management, and many more. Risk Management Activities: Identify potential risks, their possible outcomes, and countermeasures such as financial fraud risks, fraudulent transactions through cyber-attack, stolen credentials through phishing, fake ATM cards, etc. Compliance Activities: Take measures to meet legal requirements and industry standards such as PCI DSS, GLBA, etc. Moreover, this also includes implementing correct methods like SSL/ TLS to avoid Man in the Middle (MITM) attacks, ensuring automatic patch management against unpatched software, creating awareness campaigns for users to protect them from phishing attacks, and many more. Privacy and Data Protection General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) The GDPR is a data protection law implemented by the EU in May 2018 to protect personal data. Personal data is \"Any data associated with an individual that can be utilised to identify them either directly or indirectly\" Prior approval must be obtained before collecting any personal data. Personal data should be kept to a minimum and only collected when necessary. Adequate measures are to be adopted to protect stored personal data. The law applies to all business entities that conduct business in the European Union (EU) and collect/store/process the personal data of EU residents and are required to comply. It is one of the most stringent data privacy regulations worldwide and safeguards personal data during collection. Companies can only collect personal data for a legitimate reason and must inform the owner about its processing. Moreover, this also includes penalties and fines based on non-compliance in the following two tiers: Tier 1: More severe violations, including unintended data collection, sharing data with third parties without consent, etc. Maximum penalty amounting to 4% of the organisation's revenue or 20 million euros (whichever is higher). Tier 2: Less severe violations, including data breach notifications, cyber policies, etc. The maximum fine for Tier 2 is 2% of the organisation's revenue or 10 million euros (whichever is higher). Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) PCI DSS is focused on maintaining secure card transactions and protecting against data theft and fraud. It is widely used by businesses, primarily online, for card-based transactions. It was established by major credit card brands (Visa, MasterCard & American Express). It requires strict control access to cardholder information and monitoring unauthorised access, using recommended measures such as web application firewalls and encryption. You can learn more about the standard standard here NIST 800-53 Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organisations, developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), US, that provides a catalogue of security controls to protect the CIA triad of information systems. NIST 800-53 offers a comprehensive set of security and privacy controls that organisations can use to safeguard their operations, assets, personnel, and other organisations from various threats and risks. These include intentional attacks, unintentional errors, natural disasters, infrastructure failures, foreign intelligence activity, and privacy concerns. NIST 800-53 Revision 5 organises security controls into twenty families, each addressing a specific security concern category. You can learn more about the controls document here Among all the families, \"Program Management\" is one of the crucial control of the NIST 800-53 framework. Program Management control mandates establishing, implementing, and monitoring organisation-wide programs for information security and privacy while safeguarding the processed, stored, or transmitted through systems Compliance best practices businesses must conduct a thorough discovery process to recognise and catalogue their data assets, information systems, and associated threats. This includes understanding data flows, system dependencies, and potential vulnerabilities The NIST 800-53 control families must be mapped to the identified assets and hazards, making creating a structured approach for matching the controls to the organisation's demands easier. Thirdly, creating a governance structure, allocating duties, and outlining precise controls implementation and maintenance procedures are all necessary to effectively manage the implementation process. All measures must be regularly monitored and evaluated to ensure compliance. Finally, organisations should establish effective monitoring systems to identify and address security issues, conduct routine evaluations and audits, and improve control implementation. By adhering to these best practices, organisations can successfully implement NIST 800-53 and enhance their security outlook while mitigating risks effectively. NIST 800-63B NIST to help organisations establish effective digital identity practices. Its primary focus is on authenticating and verifying the identities of individuals who access digital services, systems, and networks. The guidelines provide recommendations for different levels of identity assurance, ranging from basic to high assurance. They also offer advice on using authentication factors, including passwords, biometrics, and tokens, and securely managing and storing user credentials.

ISO/IEC 27001 internationally recognised standard for requirements to plan, develop, run, and update an organisation's Information Security Management System (ISMS) International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Core components Scope: This specifies the ISMS's boundaries, including the covered assets and processes. Information security policy: A high-level document defining an organisation's information security approach. Risk assessment: Involves identifying and evaluating the risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the organisation's information. Risk treatment: Involves selecting and implementing controls to reduce the identified risks to an acceptable level. Statement of Applicability (SoA): This document specifies which controls from the standard are applicable and which are not. Internal audit: This involves conducting periodic audits of the ISMS to ensure that it is operating effectively. Management review: Review the performance of ISMS at regular intervals. An ISMS built on the ISO 27001 standard requires careful design and execution. It entails exhaustively evaluating the organisation's security procedures, detecting gaps, and conducting a thorough risk assessment. Access control, incident response, etc., are just a few examples of the areas where clear rules and processes must be created and aligned with ISO 27001 requirements. Leadership support and resource allocation are also essential for the ISMS to be implemented successfully. Regular monitoring, measurement, and continual development are crucial to guarantee the efficacy and continued alignment of the ISMS with the organization's objectives. Service Organisation Control 2 (SOC 2) developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) as a compliance/auditing framework. It focuses on assessing the efficacy of a company's data security based on the CIA triad. SOC 2 can reassure customers, stakeholders, and business partners that the company has put sufficient controls in place to safeguard its systems, data, and sensitive information. SOC 2 framework is essential for service providers interacting with client data or offering solutions that process, store, or transmit sensitive data. It assists businesses in demonstrating their dedication to upholding strict privacy and security standards. Customers frequently ask for SOC 2 reports or use them as a competitive advantage to guarantee clients that their information will be handled securely. soc report Important Cardinals SOC 2 is an auditing standard that evaluates the usefulness of a service organisation's controls related to confidentiality, availability, integrity, and privacy. Independent auditors conduct SOC 2 audits to determine that security controls meet the relevant criteria. SOC 2 reports provide valuable information to customers, stakeholders, and regulators on a service organisation's security and privacy practices. They can be used to demonstrate that the service organisation has adequate controls to protect the data and systems it uses to process customers' information. For example, a cloud computing company that provides infrastructure services to other businesses may undergo a SOC 2 audit to demonstrate its adequate controls to protect customer data stored on its servers. The audit may cover physical security, network security, data encryption, backup and recovery, and employee training and awareness. The SOC 2 audit report will assess the controls in place at the cloud computing company and include any findings or recommendations for improvement. The information can be shared with customers and other stakeholders to ensure the company takes appropriate measures to protect its data and systems. Security Protection (SOC 2) provides primary purpose of the SOC 2 audit is to ensure that third-party service providers store and process sensitive information securely. Planning SOC Audit Determine the scope: This may include specific systems, processes, or locations that are relevant to the security and privacy of customer data. Choose a suitable auditor: Select a qualified auditor with experience conducting SOC 2 audits for financial companies. Consider factors such as the auditor's reputation, experience, and availability.

For example, a company can implement a GRC program for its customer data management system. The objective might be to reduce cyber risks to 50% in the next 12 months while maintaining the trust of its customers. Conduct a risk assessment: In this step, the organisation identifies and assesses its cyber risks. For example, a risk assessment might reveal that the customer data management system is vulnerable to external attacks due to weak access controls or outdated software. The organisation can then prioritize these risks and develop a risk management strategy. Develop policies and procedures: Policies and procedures are developed to guide cyber security practices within the organisation. For example, the company might establish a password policy to ensure the usage of strong passwords. They might also implement logging and monitoring system access procedures to detect suspicious activity. Establish governance processes: Governance processes ensure the GRC program is effectively managed and controlled. For example, the organisation might establish a security steering committee that meets regularly to review security risks and make decisions about security investments and priorities. Roles and responsibilities are defined to ensure everyone understands their role in the program. Implement controls: Technical and non-technical controls are implemented to mitigate risks identified in risk assessment. For example, the company might implement firewalls, Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) to prevent external attacks and impart employee training to improve security awareness and reduce the risk of human error. Monitor and measure performance: Processes are established to monitor and measure the effectiveness of the GRC program. For example, the organisation can track metrics and compliance with security policies. This information is used to identify areas for improvement and adjust the program as needed. Continuously improve: The GRC program is constantly reviewed and improved based on performance metrics, changing risk profiles, and stakeholder feedback.

If you continue to face such technical issues, you might eventually give up and start looking for a different online store. Confidentiality: According to various laws in modern countries, healthcare providers must ensure and maintain the confidentiality of medical records. Consequently, healthcare providers can be held legally accountable if they illegally disclose their patients\u2019 medical records. Integrity: If a patient record is accidentally or maliciously altered, it can lead to the wrong treatment being administered, which, in turn, can lead to a life-threatening situation. Hence, the system would be useless and potentially harmful without ensuring the integrity of medical records. Availability: When a patient visits a clinic to follow up on their medical condition, the system must be available. An unavailable system would mean that the medical practitioner cannot access the patient\u2019s records and consequently won\u2019t know if any current symptoms are related to the patient\u2019s medical history. This situation can make the medical diagnosis more challenging and error-prone. Beyond CIA triangle Authenticity: Authentic means not fraudulent or counterfeit. Authenticity is about ensuring that the document/file/data is from the claimed source. Nonrepudiation: Repudiate means refusing to recognize the validity of something. Nonrepudiation ensures that the original source cannot deny that they are the source of a particular document/file/data. This characteristic is indispensable for various domains, such as shopping, patient diagnosis, and banking. These two requirements are closely related. The need to tell authentic files or orders from fake ones is indispensable. Moreover, ensuring that the other party cannot deny being the source is vital for many systems to be usable. Parkerian Head 6 security elemnts Availability Utility Integrity Authenticity Confidentiality Possession Utility: Utility focuses on the usefulness of the information. For instance, a user might have lost the decryption key to access a laptop with encrypted storage. Although the user still has the laptop with its disk(s) intact, they cannot access them. In other words, although still available, the information is in a form that is not useful, i.e., of no utility. Possession: This security element requires that we protect the information from unauthorized taking, copying, or controlling. For instance, an adversary might take a backup drive, meaning we lose possession of the information as long as they have the drive. Alternatively, the adversary might succeed in encrypting our data using ransomware; this also leads to the loss of possession of the data. Attack means DAD Disclosure: is the opposite of confidentiality. In other words, disclosure of confidential data would be an attack on confidentiality. Alteration: is the opposite of Integrity. For example, the integrity of a cheque is indispensable. Destruction/Denial: is the opposite of Availability. Examples Disclosure: As in most modern countries, healthcare providers must maintain medical records\u2019 confidentiality. As a result, if an attacker succeeds in stealing some of these medical records and dumping them online to be viewed publicly, the health care provider will incur a loss due to this data disclosure attack. Alteration: Consider the gravity of the situation if the attacker manages to modify patient medical records. This alteration attack might lead to the wrong treatment being administered, and consequently, this alteration attack could be life-threatening. Destruction/Denial: Consider the case where a medical facility has gone completely paperless. If an attacker manages to make the database systems unavailable, the facility will not be able to function properly. They can go back to paper temporarily; however, the patient records won\u2019t be available. This denial attack would stall the whole facility.

Clark-Wilson Model Achieve Integrity Constrained Data Item (CDI): This refers to the data type whose integrity we want to preserve. Unconstrained Data Item (UDI): This refers to all data types beyond CDI, such as user and system input. Transformation Procedures (TPs): These procedures are programmed operations, such as read and write, and should maintain the integrity of CDIs. Integrity Verification Procedures (IVPs): These procedures check and ensure the validity of CDIs. Defence in depeth Defence-in-Depth refers to creating a security system of multiple levels; hence it is also called Multi-Level Security. ISO/IEC 19249 (Internal Organization for Standardization) and Internal Electrotechnical Commission ISO/IEC 19249 lists five architectural principles: Domain Separation: Every set of related components is grouped as a single entity; components can be applications, data, or other resources. Each entity will have its own domain and be assigned a common set of security attributes. For example, consider the x86 processor privilege levels: the operating system kernel can run in ring 0 (the most privileged level). In contrast, user-mode applications can run in ring 3 (the least privileged level). Domain separation is included in the Goguen-Meseguer Model. Layering: When a system is structured into many abstract levels or layers, it becomes possible to impose security policies at different levels; moreover, it would be feasible to validate the operation. Let\u2019s consider the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model with its seven layers in networking. Each layer in the OSI model provides specific services to the layer above it. This layering makes it possible to impose security policies and easily validate that the system is working as intended. Another example from the programming world is disk operations; a programmer usually uses the disk read and write functions provided by the chosen high-level programming language. The programming language hides the low-level system calls and presents them as more user-friendly methods. Layering relates to Defence in Depth. Encapsulation: In object-oriented programming (OOP), we hide low-level implementations and prevent direct manipulation of the data in an object by providing specific methods for that purpose. For example, if you have a clock object, you would provide a method increment() instead of giving the user direct access to the seconds variable. The aim is to prevent invalid values for your variables. Similarly, in larger systems, you would use (or even design) a proper Application Programming Interface (API) that your application would use to access the database. Redundancy: This principle ensures availability and integrity. There are many examples related to redundancy. Consider the case of a hardware server with two built-in power supplies: if one power supply fails, the system continues to function. Consider a RAID 5 configuration with three drives: if one drive fails, data remains available using the remaining two drives. Moreover, if data is improperly changed on one of the disks, it would be detected via the parity, ensuring the data\u2019s integrity. Virtualization: With the advent of cloud services, virtualization has become more common and popular. The concept of virtualization is sharing a single set of hardware among multiple operating systems. Virtualization provides sandboxing capabilities that improve security boundaries, secure detonation, and observance of malicious programs. ISO/IEC 19249 teaches five design principles: Least Privilege: You can also phrase it informally as \u201cneed-to basis\u201d or \u201cneed-to-know basis\u201d as you answer the question, \u201cwho can access what?\u201d The principle of least privilege teaches that you should provide the least amount of permissions for someone to carry out their task and nothing more. For example, if a user needs to be able to view a document, you should give them read rights without write rights. Attack Surface Minimisation: Every system has vulnerabilities that an attacker might use to compromise a system. Some vulnerabilities are known, while others are yet to be discovered. These vulnerabilities represent risks that we should aim to minimize. For example, in one of the steps to harden a Linux system, we would disable any service we don\u2019t need. Centralized Parameter Validation: Many threats are due to the system receiving input, especially from users. Invalid inputs can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the system, such as denial of service and remote code execution. Therefore, parameter validation is a necessary step to ensure the correct system state. Considering the number of parameters a system handles, the validation of the parameters should be centralized within one library or system. Centralized General Security Services: As a security principle, we should aim to centralize all security services. For example, we would create a centralized server for authentication. Of course, you might take proper measures to ensure availability and prevent creating a single point of failure. Preparing for Error and Exception Handling: Whenever we build a system, we should take into account that errors and exceptions do and will occur. For instance, in a shopping application, a customer might try to place an order for an out-of-stock item. A database might get overloaded and stop responding to a web application. This principle teaches that the systems should be designed to fail safe; for example, if a firewall crashes, it should block all traffic instead of allowing all traffic. Moreover, we should be careful that error messages don\u2019t leak information that we consider confidential, such as dumping memory content that contains information related to other customers. Zero trus vs Trust but verify Trust but Verify: This principle teaches that we should always verify even when we trust an entity and its behaviour. An entity might be a user or a system. Verifying usually requires setting up proper logging mechanisms; verifying indicates going through the logs to ensure everything is normal. In reality, it is not feasible to verify everything; just think of the work it takes to review all the actions taken by a single entity, such as Internet pages browsed by a single user. This requires automated security mechanisms, such as proxy, intrusion detection, and intrusion prevention systems. Zero Trust: This principle treats trust as a vulnerability, and consequently, it caters to insider-related threats. After considering trust as a vulnerability, zero trust tries to eliminate it. It is teaching indirectly, \u201cnever trust, always verify.\u201d In other words, every entity is considered adversarial until proven otherwise. Zero trust does not grant trust to a device based on its location or ownership. This approach contrasts with older models that would trust internal networks or enterprise-owned devices. Authentication and authorization are required before accessing any resource. As a result, if any breach occurs, the damage would be more contained if a zero trust architecture had been implemented. Threat vs. risk Vulnerability: Vulnerable means susceptible to attack or damage. In information security, a vulnerability is a weakness. Threat: A threat is a potential danger associated with this weakness or vulnerability. Risk: The risk is concerned with the likelihood of a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability and the consequent impact on the business.","title":"Security Principles"},{"location":"Security/securityprinciples/#security-principles","text":"","title":"Security Principles"},{"location":"Security/securityprinciples/#cia-triangle","text":"Confidentiality: Ensures that only the intended persons or recipients can access the data Integrity: Aims to ensure that data can't be altered; moreover, we can detect any alteration if it occurs Avaliability: Aims to ensure that the system or service is available when needed","title":"CIA triangle"},{"location":"Security/securityprinciples/#exampls","text":"Confidentiality: During online shopping, you expect your credit card number to be disclosed only to the entity that processes the payment.

Manage Entra Roles Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based identity and access management service, which helps your employee's sign-in and access resources in. External resources, such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other SaaS applications. Internal resources, such as apps on your corporate network and intranet, along with any cloud apps developed by your own organization. Who uses Microsoft Entra ID IT admins: can use Microsoft Entra ID to control access to your apps and your app resources, based on your business requirements. For example, you can use Microsoft Entra ID to require multifactor authentication when accessing important organizational resources. Additionally, you can use Microsoft Entra ID to automate user provisioning between your existing Windows Server AD and your cloud apps, including Microsoft 365. Finally, Microsoft Entra ID gives you powerful tools to automatically help protect user identities and credentials and to meet your access governance requirements. App Developer: can use Microsoft Entra ID as a standards-based approach for adding single sign-on (SSO) to your app, allowing it to work with a user's preexisting credentials. Microsoft Entra ID also provides APIs that can help you build personalized app experiences using existing organizational data. Microsoft 365, Office 365, Azure, or Dynamics CRM Online subscribers: Each Microsoft 365, Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics CRM Online tenant is automatically a Microsoft Entra tenant. You can immediately start to manage access to your integrated cloud apps.

Stabilization: Your organizational structure is defined, and the number of administrative units isn't going to change significantly in the short term. Delegate Administration in Entra ID Restricting who can create applications and manage the applications they create. By default in Microsoft Entra ID, all users can register application registrations and manage all aspects of applications they create. You can restrict to only allow selected people that permission. Assigning one or more owners to an application. A simple way to grant someone the ability to manage all aspects of Microsoft Entra ID configuration for a specific application. Assigning a built-in administrative role that grants access to manage configuration in Microsoft Entra ID for all applications. The recommended way to grant IT experts access to manage broad application configuration permissions without granting access to manage other parts of Microsoft Entra ID not related to application configuration. Create a custom role to define specific permissions. Then assign the role to a user to assign a limited-owner. Or you could assign at the directory scope - all applications - as a limited-administrator. Delegation Plan Define the roles you need Delegate app administration Grant the ability to register applications Delegate app ownership Develop a security plan Establish emergency accounts Secure your administrator roles Make privileged elevation temporary Define Roles Tasks that you do routinely, have limited risk, and are trivial to complete are excellent candidates for delegation. Tasks that you do rarely but have potential risk across the organization and require high skill levels should be considered carefully before delegating. Instead, you can temporarily elevate an account to the required role or reassign the task. Delegate App Administrator Application Administrator: grants the ability to manage all applications in the directory, including registrations, single sign-on settings, user and group assignments and licensing, Application Proxy settings, and consent. It doesn't grant the ability to manage Conditional Access. Cloud Application Administrator: grants all the abilities of the Application Administrator, except it doesn't grant access to Application Proxy settings. Delegate App Ownership Enterprise Application Owner: grants the ability to manage the \u2018enterprise applications that the user owns, including single sign-on settings, user and group assignments, and adding more owners. It doesn't grant the ability to manage Application Proxy settings or Conditional Access. Application Registration Owner: grants the ability to manage application registrations for app that the user owns, including the application manifest and adding other owners.

Error The number of objects to be renamed is greater than 1000 One of the applications to be renamed is a multitenant app Member vs Guest User Member users: register applications, manage their own profile photo and mobile phone number, change their own password, and invite B2B guests. In addition, users can read all directory information (with a few exceptions). Guest users: have restricted directory permissions. They can manage their own profile, change their own password, and retrieve some information about other users, groups, and apps; however, they can't read all directory information. For example, guest users can't enumerate the list of all users, groups, and other directory objects. Guests can be added to administrator roles, which grant them full read and write permissions contained in the role. Guests can also invite other guests. User permissions Users can register application By default, member users can register applications. Setting this option to No prevents users from creating application registrations. The ability can then be granted back to specific individuals by adding them to the Application Developer role. Restrict access to Microsoft Entra administration portal Setting this option to No lets non-administrators use the Microsoft Entra administration portal to read and manage Microsoft Entra resources. Yes restricts all non-administrators from accessing any Microsoft Entra data in the administration portal. This setting doesn't restrict access to Microsoft Entra data using PowerShell or other clients such as Visual Studio. When set to Yes, to grant a specific non-admin user the ability to use the Microsoft Entra administration portal assign any administrative role such as the Directory Readers role. This role allows reading basic directory information, which member users have by default (guests and service principals don't).

Microsoft's Software as a Service (SaaS)-based cloud offerings (Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365) charge per-user license fees. Microsoft's Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud offerings (Azure) charge based on cloud resource consumption. You can also use a trial subscription, but the subscription expires after a specific amount of time or consumption charges. You can convert a trial subscription to a paid subscription. Organizations can have multiple subscriptions for Microsoft's cloud offerings. License: For Microsoft's SaaS cloud offerings, a license allows a specific user account to use the services of the cloud offering. You're charged a fixed monthly fee as part of your subscription. Administrators assign licenses to individual user accounts in the subscription. Authorization Covers what an identity can access and what are they allowed to do once they gain access identity authorization provides: Methods of assigning entitlement allowing for increased security and less administration Ability to manage policy control Simplify enforcement by standardizing on a common approach Authorization concept Entitlement Type: Entitlements focus on whether or not an identity has been granted (\u201centitled\u201d) access to a particular resource. As such, entitlements are handled using many different types. The assignment of entitlements happens at the application level, centrally via groups, defined through role based access control or attributes (ABAC) or applied centrally using a policy based (PBAC) approach. Access Policies: Focus on set of applications, data, and which users and groups can perform activities. Set of rules around getting your job done. Least access needed Enforcement: The enforcement capability focuses on how an organization handles the enforcement of authorization activities. In most cases, organizations handle enforcement at the application layer. Meaning enforcement is completed by an API within the application itself. Some forms of enforcement consist of the use a reverse proxy (such as UAG) to externalize authorization enforcement. A current trend is to use an external policy source (such as XACML) to determine how the identity interacts with the resource. Authorization (AuthZ): Set permissions that are used to elevate access to resources or functionality Authentication (AuthN): proving that an entity like a user or service is indeed who they claim to be Authorization approaches Access Control Lists (ACL): Explicit list of specific entities who do or don't have access to a resource or functionality. Offers fine control over resources, but difficult to maintain large groups of users and resources Role based Access control (RBAC): Roles are defined to describe the kinds of activities an entity can perform. Grant access to roles rather than to individual entities. An administrator can then assign roles to different entities to control which ones have access to what resources and functionality. Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC): Rules are applied to attributes of the entity, the resources being accessed, and the current environment to determine whether access to some resources or functionality is permitted. An example might be only allowing users who are managers to access files identified with a metadata tag of \u201cmanagers during working hours only\u201d during the hours of 9AM - 5PM on working days. In this case, access is determined by examining the user\u2019s attribute (status as manager), the resource\u2019s attribute (metadata tag on a file), and also an environment attribute (the current time). Policy-based Access Control (PBAC): A strategy for managing user access to one or more systems, where the business-role of the user is combined with policies to determine what access the user has. Authentication Context: These applications can be your own custom applications, custom line of business (LOB) applications, applications like SharePoint, or applications protected by Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. For example, an organization can keep files in SharePoint sites like the lunch menu or their secret BBQ sauce recipe. Everyone has access to the lunch menu site. However, users who have access to the secret BBQ sauce recipe site are required to connect from a managed device. Auditing in Identity Auditing provides a way for an administrator to detect an attack that has already occurred or is in progress. Also, auditing is a tool for compliance and tracking what identity did what. In addition, auditing can help a developer to debug security-related problems. For example, if an error in the configuration of the authorization or checking policy accidentally denies access to an authorized user, a developer can quickly discover and isolate the cause of this error by examining the event log. Goverance governance is the act or process of overseeing the control and direction of a system. That system could be a government, a budget, or an identity solution on Azure. Governance has processes and controls in place to both operate the systems and to evaluate the accountable running of the system. It's never enough to build a solution and then forget it. You have to monitor its running, update the processes regularly, remove or replace outdated features, and so on. If you don't, the system is slowly going to degrade and fail. Identity lifecycle management Identity Lifecycle Management aims to automate and manage the entire digital identity lifecycle process. Are there already systems of record: data sources, which the organization treats as authoritative. For example, the organization might have an HR system. That system is authoritative for providing the current list of employees, and some of their properties such as the employee's name or department. Compare the system of record with one or more directories and databases used by applications, and resolve any inconsistencies between the directories and the systems of record. Determine what processes can be used to supply authoritative information for visitors. It is necessary to find an alternate way to determine when a digital identity for a visitor is no longer needed. Management strategy Join: when an individual comes into scope of needing access, an identity is needed by those applications, so a new digital identity might need to be created if one isn't already available. Move: when an individual moves between boundaries, extra access authorization is required to be added or removed to their digital identity. Leave: when an individual leaves the scope of needing access, access might need to be removed, and the identity is no longer be required by applications other than for audit or forensics purposes.

Access Policies: Focus on set of applications, data, and which users and groups can perform activities. Set of rules around getting your job done. Least access needed Enforcement: The enforcement capability focuses on how an organization handles the enforcement of authorization activities. In most cases, organizations handle enforcement at the application layer. Meaning enforcement is completed by an API within the application itself. Some forms of enforcement consist of the use a reverse proxy (such as UAG) to externalize authorization enforcement. A current trend is to use an external policy source (such as XACML) to determine how the identity interacts with the resource.

Grant access to roles rather than to individual entities. An administrator can then assign roles to different entities to control which ones have access to what resources and functionality. Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC): Rules are applied to attributes of the entity, the resources being accessed, and the current environment to determine whether access to some resources or functionality is permitted. An example might be only allowing users who are managers to access files identified with a metadata tag of \u201cmanagers during working hours only\u201d during the hours of 9AM - 5PM on working days. In this case, access is determined by examining the user\u2019s attribute (status as manager), the resource\u2019s attribute (metadata tag on a file), and also an environment attribute (the current time).

Security groups can be synced from on-premises, by using Microsoft Entra Connect. You can also create security groups directly in Microsoft Entra ID (also called cloud-only groups), or automatically via the Microsoft Entra dynamic group feature. When a product license is assigned to a group, the administrator can disable one or more service plans in the product. Typically, this assignment is done when the organization is not yet ready to start using a service included in a product. For example, the administrator might assign Microsoft 365 to a department, but temporarily disable the Yammer service. All Microsoft cloud services that require user-level licensing are supported. This support includes all Microsoft 365 products, Enterprise Mobility + Security, and Dynamics 365. Group-based licensing is currently available only through the Azure portal. (coming soon to the Microsoft Entra admin center) Microsoft Entra ID automatically manages license modifications that result from group membership changes. Typically, license modifications are effective within minutes of a membership change. A user can be a member of multiple groups with license policies specified. A user can also have some licenses that were directly assigned, outside of any groups. The resulting user state is a combination of all assigned product and service licenses. If a user is assigned same license from multiple sources, the license will be consumed only once. In some cases, licenses cannot be assigned to a user. For example, there might not be enough available licenses in the tenant, or conflicting services might have been assigned at the same time. Administrators have access to information about users for whom Microsoft Entra ID could not fully process group licenses. They can then take corrective action based on that information. Change group license assignments Microsoft Entra Admin center -> Groups -> All Groups -> Manage -> Licenses Assignments -> Microsoft Admin center -> Billing -> Licenses -> select license -> Groups -> Assign License Set-MgUserLicense: there might be an insufficient number of licenses or a conflict between two service plans that can't be assigned at the same time Not enough licenses Problem: There aren't enough available licenses for one of the products that's specified in the group. You need to either purchase more licenses for the product or free up unused licenses from other users or groups. See how many license: Microsoft Entra -> Identity -> Billing -> License -> All Products Licensed users: you see a list of all users who have had licenses assigned directly or via one or more groups. Licensed groups: you see all groups with product licenses assigned. PowerShell cmdlets report this error as CountViolation. Service plans that conflict Problem: One of the products that's specified in the group contains a service plan that conflicts with another service plan that's already assigned to the user via a different product. Some service plans are configured in a way that they can't be assigned to the same user as another, related service plan. A user has a license for Office 365 Enterprise E1 assigned directly, with all the plans enabled. The user has been added to a group that has the Office 365 Enterprise E3 product assigned to it. The E3 product contains service plans that can't overlap with the plans that are included in E1, so the group license assignment fails with the Conflicting service plans error. In this example, the conflicting service plans are: SharePoint Online (Plan 2) conflicts with SharePoint Online (Plan 1). Exchange Online (Plan 2) conflicts with Exchange Online (Plan 1). To solve this conflict, you need to disable two of the plans. You can disable the E1 license that's directly assigned to the user. Or, you need to modify the entire group license assignment and disable the plans in the E3 license. Alternatively, you might decide to remove the E1 license from the user if it's redundant in the context of the E3 license. PowerShell cmdlets report this error as MutuallyExclusiveViolation Products depend on license Problem: One of the products that's specified in the group contains a service plan that must be enabled for another service plan, in another product, to function. This error occurs when Microsoft Entra ID attempts to remove the underlying service plan. For example, this can happen when you remove the user from the group. To solve this problem, you need to make sure that the required plan is still assigned to users through some other method or that the dependent services are disabled for those users. After doing that, you can properly remove the group license from those users. PowerShell cmdlets report this error as DependencyViolation. Location isn't allowed Problem: Some Microsoft services aren't available in all locations because of local laws and regulations. Before you can assign a license to a user, you must specify the Usage location property for the user. You can specify the location under the User, then Profile, then Edit the section in the Azure portal. When Microsoft Entra ID attempts to assign a group license to a user whose usage location isn't supported, it fails and records an error on the user. To solve this problem, remove users from unsupported locations from the licensed group. Alternatively, if the current usage location values don't represent the actual user location, you can modify them so that the licenses are correctly assigned next time (if the new location is supported). PowerShell cmdlets report this error as ProhibitedInUsageLocationViolation. Microsoft Entra Mail and ProxyAddress attribute Problem: While updating license assignment on a user or a group, you might see that the Microsoft Entra Mail and ProxyAddresses attribute of some users are changed. Updating license assignment on a user causes the proxy address calculation to be triggered, which can change user attributes. LicenseAssignmentAttributeConcurrencyException in audit logs Problem: User has LicenseAssignmentAttributeConcurrencyException for license assignment in audit logs. When group-based licensing tries to process concurrent license assignment of the same license to a user, this exception is recorded on the user. This typically happens when a user is a member of more than one group with same assigned license. Microsoft Entra ID will retry processing the user license and will resolve the issue. There is no action required from the customer to fix this issue. Multiple licenses Microsoft Entra ID attempts to assign all licenses that are specified in the group to each user. If Microsoft Entra ID can't assign one of the products because of business logic problems, it won't assign the other licenses in the group either. An example is if there aren't enough licenses for all, or if there are conflicts with other services that are enabled on the user. Licensed group deletion Must remove all licenses before deletion of group License with prerequise Microsoft Workplace Analytics is an add-on product. It contains a single service plan with the same name. We can only assign this service plan to a user, or group, when one of the following prerequisites is also assigned: Exchange Online (Plan 1) Exchange Online (Plan 2) If we try to assign this product on its own to a group, the portal returns a notification message. If we select the item details, it shows the following error message: License operation failed. Make sure that the group has necessary services before adding or removing a dependent service. The service Microsoft Workplace Analytics requires Exchange Online (Plan 2) to be enabled as well. To assign this add-on license to a group, we must ensure that the group also contains the prerequisite service plan. For example, we might update an existing group that already contains the full Office 365 E3 product, and then add the add-on product to it. It is also possible to create a standalone group that contains only the minimum required products to make the add-on work. It can then be used to license only selected users for the add-on product. Based on the previous example, you would assign the following products to the same group: Office 365 Enterprise E3 with only the Exchange Online (Plan 2) service plan enabled Microsoft Workplace Analytics From now on, any users added to this group consume one license of the E3 product and one license of the Workplace Analytics product. At the same time, those users can be members of another group that gives them the full E3 product, and they still consume only one license for that product. Force group license process to resolve errors For example, if you free up some licenses by removing direct license assignments from users, you need to trigger the processing of groups that previously failed to fully license all user members. To reprocess a group, go to the group pane, open Licenses, and then select the Reprocess button on the toolbar. Force user license process to resolve users For example, after you resolve duplicate proxy address problem for an affected user, you need to trigger the processing of the user. To reprocess a user, go to the user pane, open Licenses, and then select the Reprocess button on the toolbar. Migrate users with individual licenese to group license Recommend migration process You have existing automation (for example, PowerShell) managing license assignment and removal for users. Leave it running as is. Create a new licensing group (or decide which existing groups to use) and make sure that all required users are added as members. Assign the required licenses to those groups; your goal should be to reflect the same licensing state your existing automation (for example, PowerShell) is applying to those users. Verify that licenses have been applied to all users in those groups. This application can be done by checking the processing state on each group and by checking Audit Logs. You can perform a random check of a few individual users by looking at their license details. You will see that they have the same licenses assigned \u201cdirectly\u201d and \u201cinherited\u201d from groups. You can run a PowerShell script to verify how licenses are assigned to users. When the same product license is assigned to the user both directly and through a group, only one license is consumed by the user. Hence no additional licenses are required to perform migration. Verify that no license assignments failed by checking each group for users in error state. Consider removing the original direct assignments. We recommend that you do it gradually, and monitor the outcome on a subset of users first. If you leave the original direct assignments on users, when the users leave their licensed groups they retain the directly assigned licenses, which might not be what you want. change licenese assignments for a user or group in Entra ID Users have the current license plan that's assigned to a group and inherited by the user and not assigned directly. You have enough available licenses for the license plan you're assigning. If you don't have enough licenses, some users might not be assigned the new license plan. You can check the number of available licenses. Always confirm users don't have assigned service licenses that can conflict with the desired license or prevent removal of the current license. For example, a license from a service such as Workplace Analytics or Project Online that has a dependency on other services. If you manage groups on-premises and sync them into Microsoft Entra ID via Microsoft Entra Connect, then you add or remove users by using your on-premises system. It can take some time for the changes to sync with Microsoft Entra ID to be picked up by group licensing. If you're using Microsoft Entra dynamic group memberships, you add or remove users by changing their attributes, but the update process for license assignments remains the same. Custom Security Attribute Custom security attributes in Microsoft Entra ID are business-specific attributes (key-value pairs) that you can define and assign to Microsoft Entra objects. These attributes can be used to store information, categorize objects, or enforce fine-grained access control over specific Azure resources. Why use custom security attributes Extend user profiles, such as add Employee Hire Date and Hourly Salary to all my employees. Ensure only administrators can see the Hourly Salary attribute in my employees' profiles. Categorize hundreds or thousands of applications to easily create a filterable inventory for auditing Grant users access to the Azure Storage blobs belonging to a project. What to do with custom security attributes Define business-specific information (attributes) for your tenant. Add a set of custom security attributes on users, applications, Microsoft Entra resources, or Azure resources. Manage Microsoft Entra objects using custom security attributes with queries and filters. Provide attribute governance so attributes determine who can get access. Custom security features Available tenant-wide Include a description Support different data types: Boolean, integer, string Support single value or multiple values Support user-defined free-form values or predefined values Assign custom security attributes to directory synced users from an on-premises Active Directory System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) Automatic user creation HCM system: Applications and technologies that enable Human Capital Management process and practices that support and automate HR processes throughout the employee lifecycle.

Security groups can be synced from on-premises, by using Microsoft Entra Connect. You can also create security groups directly in Microsoft Entra ID (also called cloud-only groups), or automatically via the Microsoft Entra dynamic group feature. When a product license is assigned to a group, the administrator can disable one or more service plans in the product. Typically, this assignment is done when the organization is not yet ready to start using a service included in a product. For example, the administrator might assign Microsoft 365 to a department, but temporarily disable the Yammer service. All Microsoft cloud services that require user-level licensing are supported. This support includes all Microsoft 365 products, Enterprise Mobility + Security, and Dynamics 365. Group-based licensing is currently available only through the Azure portal. (coming soon to the Microsoft Entra admin center) Microsoft Entra ID automatically manages license modifications that result from group membership changes. Typically, license modifications are effective within minutes of a membership change. A user can be a member of multiple groups with license policies specified. A user can also have some licenses that were directly assigned, outside of any groups. The resulting user state is a combination of all assigned product and service licenses. If a user is assigned same license from multiple sources, the license will be consumed only once. In some cases, licenses cannot be assigned to a user. For example, there might not be enough available licenses in the tenant, or conflicting services might have been assigned at the same time. Administrators have access to information about users for whom Microsoft Entra ID could not fully process group licenses. They can then take corrective action based on that information.","title":"Microsoft Entra Licenses"},{"location":"Window%20Server/ManageIdenties/#change-group-license-assignments","text":"Microsoft Entra Admin center -> Groups -> All Groups -> Manage -> Licenses Assignments -> Microsoft Admin center -> Billing -> Licenses -> select license -> Groups -> Assign License Set-MgUserLicense: there might be an insufficient number of licenses or a conflict between two service plans that can't be assigned at the same time","title":"Change group license assignments"},{"location":"Window%20Server/ManageIdenties/#not-enough-licenses","text":"Problem: There aren't enough available licenses for one of the products that's specified in the group.

Verify that no license assignments failed by checking each group for users in error state. Consider removing the original direct assignments.
