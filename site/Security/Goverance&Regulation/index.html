</ul>
<h3 id="developing-goverance-documents">Developing Goverance Documents</h3>
<ul>
<li>Identify the scope and purpose:  Determine what the document will cover and why it is needed. For example, a password policy might be required to ensure robust and secure user passwords. In contrast, a baseline might be required to establish a minimum level of security for all systems.</li>
<li>Research and review: Research relevant laws, regulations, industry standards, and best practices to ensure your document is comprehensive and up-to-date. Review existing policies, procedures, and other documents to avoid duplicating efforts or contradicting existing guidance.</li>
<li>Draft the document: Develop an outline and start drafting the document, following best practices for writing clear and concise policies, procedures, standards, guidelines, and baselines. Ensure the document is specific, actionable, and aligned with the organisation's goals and values.</li>
<li>Review and approval: Have the document reviewed by stakeholders, such as subject matter experts, legal and compliance teams, and senior management. Incorporate their feedback and ensure the document aligns with organisational goals and values. Obtain final approval from appropriate stakeholders.</li>
<li>Implementation and communication: Communicate the document to all relevant employees and stakeholders, and ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities in implementing it. Develop training and awareness programs to ensure the document is understood and followed.</li>
<li>Review and update: Periodically review and update the document to ensure it remains relevant and practical. Monitor compliance and adjust the document based on feedback and changes in the threat landscape or regulatory environment.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="preparing-password-policy">Preparing password policy</h4>
<ul>
<li>Define password requirements: Minimum length, complexity, and expiration.</li>
<li>Define password usage guidelines: Specify how passwords should be used, such as requiring unique passwords for each account, prohibiting the sharing of passwords, and prohibiting default passwords.</li>
<li>Define password storage and transmission guidelines: Using encryption for password storage and requiring secure connections for password transmission.</li>
<li>Define password change and reset guidelines: How often passwords should be changed etc.</li>
<li>Communicate the policy: Communicate the password policy to all relevant employees and stakeholders, and ensure that they understand the requirements and guidelines. Develop training and awareness programs to ensure that employees follow the policy.</li>
<li>Monitor compliance: Monitor compliance with the password policy and adjust the policy as needed based on feedback and changes in the threat landscape or regulatory environment.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="governance-and-risk-compliance-grc-framework">Governance and Risk Compliance (GRC) framework</h2>
<ul>
<li>Governance Component: Involves guiding an organisation by setting its direction through information security strategy,  which includes policies, standards, baselines, frameworks, etc., along with establishing appropriate monitoring methods to measure its performance and assess the outcomes.</li>
<li>Risk Management Component: Involves identifying, assessing, and prioritising risks to the organisation and implementing controls and mitigation strategies to manage those risks effectively. This includes monitoring and reporting on risks and continuously evaluating and refining the risk management program to ensure its ongoing effectiveness.</li>
<li>Compliance Component: Ensuring that the organisation meets its legal, regulatory, and industry obligations and that its activities align with its policies and procedures. This includes developing and implementing compliance programs, conducting regular audits and assessments, and reporting on compliance issues to stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="develop-grc-program">Develop GRC Program</h3>
<ul>
<li>Define the scope and objectives: This step involves determining the scope of the GRC program and defining its goals. For example, a company can implement a GRC program for its customer data management system. The objective might be to reduce cyber risks to 50% in the next 12 months while maintaining the trust of its customers.</li>
<li>Conduct a risk assessment: In this step, the organisation identifies and assesses its cyber risks. For example, a risk assessment might reveal that the customer data management system is vulnerable to external attacks due to weak access controls or outdated software. The organisation can then prioritize these risks and develop a risk management strategy.</li>
<li>Develop policies and procedures: Policies and procedures are developed to guide cyber security practices within the organisation. For example, the company might establish a password policy to ensure the usage of strong passwords. They might also implement logging and monitoring system access procedures to detect suspicious activity.</li>
<li>Establish governance processes: Governance processes ensure the GRC program is effectively managed and controlled. For example, the organisation might establish a security steering committee that meets regularly to review security risks and make decisions about security investments and priorities. Roles and responsibilities are defined to ensure everyone understands their role in the program.</li>
<li>Implement controls: Technical and non-technical controls are implemented to mitigate risks identified in risk assessment. For example, the company might implement firewalls, Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) to prevent external attacks and impart employee training to improve security awareness and reduce the risk of human error.</li>
<li>Monitor and measure performance: Processes are established to monitor and measure the effectiveness of the GRC program. For example, the organisation can track metrics and compliance with security policies. This information is used to identify areas for improvement and adjust the program as needed.</li>
<li>Continuously improve: The GRC program is constantly reviewed and improved based on performance metrics, changing risk profiles, and stakeholder feedback. For example, suppose the organisation experiences a security incident. In that case, it might conduct a post-incident analysis to identify the root cause and make changes to prevent a similar incident from happening again.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="grc-framework-example">GRC Framework Example</h3>
<ul>
<li>Governance-Related Activities: Nominate the governance level executives, and make financial-related policies such as bank secrecy act, anti-money laundering policy, financial audit policies, financial reporting, crisis management, and many more.</li>
<li>Risk Management Activities: Identify potential risks, their possible outcomes, and countermeasures such as financial fraud risks, fraudulent transactions through cyber-attack, stolen credentials through phishing, fake ATM cards, etc.</li>
<li>Compliance Activities: Take measures to meet legal requirements and industry standards such as PCI DSS, GLBA, etc. Moreover, this also includes implementing correct methods like SSL/ TLS to avoid Man in the Middle (MITM) attacks, ensuring automatic patch management against unpatched software, creating awareness campaigns for users to protect them from phishing attacks, and many more.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="privacy-and-data-protection">Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
<h3 id="general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
<p>The GDPR is a data protection law implemented by the EU in May 2018 to protect personal data. Personal data is "Any data associated with an individual that can be utilised to identify them either directly or indirectly"</p>
<ul>
<li>Prior approval must be obtained before collecting any personal data.</li>
<li>Personal data should be kept to a minimum and only collected when necessary.</li>
<li>Adequate measures are to be adopted to protect stored personal data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The law applies to all business entities that conduct business in the European Union (EU) and collect/store/process the personal data of EU residents and are required to comply. It is one of the most stringent data privacy regulations worldwide and safeguards personal data during collection. Companies can only collect personal data for a legitimate reason and must inform the owner about its processing. Moreover, this also includes penalties and fines based on non-compliance in the following two tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 1: More severe violations, including unintended data collection, sharing data with third parties without consent, etc. Maximum penalty amounting to 4% of the organisation's revenue or 20 million euros (whichever is higher).</li>
<li>Tier 2: Less severe violations, including data breach notifications, cyber policies, etc. The maximum fine for Tier 2 is 2% of the organisation's revenue or 10 million euros (whichever is higher).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="payment-card-industry-data-security-standard-pci-dss">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)</h3>
<p>PCI DSS is focused on maintaining secure card transactions and protecting against data theft and fraud. It is widely used by businesses, primarily online, for card-based transactions. It was established by major credit card brands (Visa, MasterCard &amp; American Express). It requires strict control access to cardholder information and monitoring unauthorised access, using recommended measures such as web application firewalls and encryption.

<h2 id="nist-800-53">NIST 800-53</h2>
<p>Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organisations, developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), US, that provides a catalogue of security controls to protect the CIA triad of information systems.</p>
<p><img alt="NIST 80053" src="../../images/NIST80053security.png" /></p>
<p>NIST 800-53 offers a comprehensive set of security and privacy controls that organisations can use to safeguard their operations, assets, personnel, and other organisations from various threats and risks. These include intentional attacks, unintentional errors, natural disasters, infrastructure failures, foreign intelligence activity, and privacy concerns. NIST 800-53 Revision 5 organises security controls into twenty families, each addressing a specific security concern category. You can learn more about the controls <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf">document here</a></p>
<p><img alt="program management" src="../../images/programmanagementNIST80053.png" /></p>
<p>Among all the families, "Program Management" is one of the crucial control of the NIST 800-53 framework. Program Management control mandates establishing, implementing, and monitoring organisation-wide programs for information security and privacy while safeguarding the processed, stored, or transmitted through systems</p>
<h3 id="compliance-best-practices">Compliance best practices</h3>
<p><img alt="NIST Policies" src="../../images/NIST80053policies.png" />
businesses must conduct a thorough discovery process to recognise and catalogue their data assets, information systems, and associated threats. This includes understanding data flows, system dependencies, and potential vulnerabilities
The NIST 800-53 control families must be mapped to the identified assets and hazards, making creating a structured approach for matching the controls to the organisation's demands easier. Thirdly, creating a governance structure, allocating duties, and outlining precise controls implementation and maintenance procedures are all necessary to effectively manage the implementation process. All measures must be regularly monitored and evaluated to ensure compliance. Finally, organisations should establish effective monitoring systems to identify and address security issues, conduct routine evaluations and audits, and improve control implementation. By adhering to these best practices, organisations can successfully implement NIST 800-53 and enhance their security outlook while mitigating risks effectively.</p>

<li>Independent auditors conduct SOC 2 audits to determine that security controls meet the relevant criteria.</li>
<li>SOC 2 reports provide valuable information to customers, stakeholders, and regulators on a service organisation's security and privacy practices. They can be used to demonstrate that the service organisation has adequate controls to protect the data and systems it uses to process customers' information. For example, a cloud computing company that provides infrastructure services to other businesses may undergo a SOC 2 audit to demonstrate its adequate controls to protect customer data stored on its servers. The audit may cover physical security, network security, data encryption, backup and recovery, and employee training and awareness.</li>
<li>The SOC 2 audit report will assess the controls in place at the cloud computing company and include any findings or recommendations for improvement. The information can be shared with customers and other stakeholders to ensure the company takes appropriate measures to protect its data and systems.</li>
