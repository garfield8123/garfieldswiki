You need a Microsoft Entra ID P2 license if you want to use privileged Identity Management (PMI) capability in Microsoft Entra ID. Any user that assigns or manages assignments in PIM needs to have a license. A User within privileged user doesn't need a license</li>
<li>Microsoft 365, Office 365, Windows License: License assigned to Microsoft Entra user or group to grant themm access to use Office or Windows products. You need one license for each user who needs access to Windows and/or Office</li>
<li>Monthly Active User (MAU) License: License used with Microsoft Entra External Identities. A monthly report pulled for billing purposes, looking for external users logging in during the month</li>

<ul>
<li>Subscription: An agreement with Microsoft to use one or more Microsoft cloud platforms or services for which charages accure based on either a per user or a cloud-based resource consumption. Microsoft's Software as a Service (SaaS)-based cloud offerings (Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365) charge per-user license fees. Microsoft's Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud offerings (Azure) charge based on cloud resource consumption. You can also use a trial subscription, but the subscription expires after a specific amount of time or consumption charges. You can convert a trial subscription to a paid subscription. Organizations can have multiple subscriptions for Microsoft's cloud offerings.</li>
<li>License: For Microsoft's SaaS cloud offerings, a license allows a specific user account to use the services of the cloud offering. You're charged a fixed monthly fee as part of your subscription. Administrators assign licenses to individual user accounts in the subscription.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="authorization">Authorization</h2>
<p>Covers what an identity can access and what are they allowed to do once they gain access identity authorization provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Methods of assigning entitlement allowing for increased security and less administration</li>
<li>Ability to manage policy control</li>
<li>Simplify enforcement by standardizing on a common approach</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="authorization-concept">Authorization concept</h2>
<ul>
<li>Entitlement Type: Entitlements focus on whether or not an identity has been granted (“entitled”) access to a particular resource. As such, entitlements are handled using many different types. The assignment of entitlements happens at the application level, centrally via groups, defined through role based access control or attributes (ABAC) or applied centrally using a policy based (PBAC) approach.</li>
<li>Access Policies: Focus on set of applications, data, and which users and groups can perform activities. Set of rules around getting your job done. Least access needed</li>
<li>
<p>Enforcement: The enforcement capability focuses on how an organization handles the enforcement of authorization activities. In most cases, organizations handle enforcement at the application layer. Meaning enforcement is completed by an API within the application itself. Some forms of enforcement consist of the use a reverse proxy (such as UAG) to externalize authorization enforcement. A current trend is to use an external policy source (such as XACML) to determine how the identity interacts with the resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authorization (AuthZ): Set permissions that are used to elevate access to resources or functionality</p>
</li>
<li>Authentication (AuthN): proving that an entity like a user or service is indeed who they claim to be</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="authorization-approaches">Authorization approaches</h2>
<ul>
<li>Access Control Lists (ACL): Explicit list of specific entities who do or don't have access to a resource or functionality. Offers fine control over resources, but difficult to maintain large groups of users and resources</li>
<li>Role based Access control (RBAC): Roles are defined to describe the kinds of activities an entity can perform. Grant access to roles rather than to individual entities. An administrator can then assign roles to different entities to control which ones have access to what resources and functionality.</li>
<li>Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC): Rules are applied to attributes of the entity, the resources being accessed, and the current environment to determine whether access to some resources or functionality is permitted. An example might be only allowing users who are managers to access files identified with a metadata tag of “managers during working hours only” during the hours of 9AM - 5PM on working days. In this case, access is determined by examining the user’s attribute (status as manager), the resource’s attribute (metadata tag on a file), and also an environment attribute (the current time).</li>
<li>Policy-based Access Control (PBAC): A strategy for managing user access to one or more systems, where the business-role of the user is combined with policies to determine what access the user has.</li>
<li>Authentication Context: These applications can be your own custom applications, custom line of business (LOB) applications, applications like SharePoint, or applications protected by Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. For example, an organization can keep files in SharePoint sites like the lunch menu or their secret BBQ sauce recipe. Everyone has access to the lunch menu site. However, users who have access to the secret BBQ sauce recipe site are required to connect from a managed device.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="auditing-in-identity">Auditing in Identity</h2>
<p>Auditing provides a way for an administrator to detect an attack that has already occurred or is in progress. Also, auditing is a tool for compliance and tracking what identity did what. In addition, auditing can help a developer to debug security-related problems. For example, if an error in the configuration of the authorization or checking policy accidentally denies access to an authorized user, a developer can quickly discover and isolate the cause of this error by examining the event log.</p>
<h2 id="goverance">Goverance</h2>
<p>governance is the act or process of overseeing the control and direction of a system. That system could be a government, a budget, or an identity solution on Azure. Governance has processes and controls in place to both operate the systems and to evaluate the accountable running of the system. It's never enough to build a solution and then forget it. You have to monitor its running, update the processes regularly, remove or replace outdated features, and so on. If you don't, the system is slowly going to degrade and fail.</p>
<h2 id="identity-lifecycle-management">Identity lifecycle management</h2>
<p>Identity Lifecycle Management aims to automate and manage the entire digital identity lifecycle process.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are there already systems of record: data sources, which the organization treats as authoritative. For example, the organization might have an HR system. That system is authoritative for providing the current list of employees, and some of their properties such as the employee's name or department.</li>
<li>Compare the system of record with one or more directories and databases used by applications, and resolve any inconsistencies between the directories and the systems of record.</li>
<li>Determine what processes can be used to supply authoritative information for visitors. It is necessary to find an alternate way to determine when a digital identity for a visitor is no longer needed.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="management-strategy">Management strategy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Join: when an individual comes into scope of needing access, an identity is needed by those applications, so a new digital identity might need to be created if one isn't already available.</li>
<li>Move: when an individual moves between boundaries, extra access authorization is required to be added or removed to their digital identity.</li>
<li>Leave: when an individual leaves the scope of needing access, access might need to be removed, and the identity is no longer be required by applications other than for audit or forensics purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="monitoring-tools">Monitoring tools</h2>
<ul>
<li>Azure Monitor</li>
<li>Application Insights</li>
<li>Azure Service Health</li>
<li>Azure Resource Health</li>
<li>Azure Resource Manager</li>
<li>Azure Policy</li>
